    <p>
      The second entry in the Silent Hill franchise, Silent Hill 2 is a
      narrative-focused third-person psychological survival horror game with
      emphasis on combat, exploration and puzzle-solving elements which follows
      James Sunderland, a man who receives a letter, seemingly sent by his
      three-years-deceased wife Mary, in which he is beckoned to the fog-ridden
      town of Silent Hill at the same time as numerous other people troubled by
      their past.
